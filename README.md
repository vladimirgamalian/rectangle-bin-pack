# rectangle-bin-pack

Fast (in native c++) implementation of bin packing algorithm for Node.js. Based on https://github.com/juj/RectangleBinPack.

## Install

```
$ npm install --save-dev rectangle-bin-pack
```


## Usage

```js
var rbp = require('rectangle-bin-pack');

var rects = [{w: 10, h: 10}, {w: 25, h: 25}, {w: 15, h: 15}];
rbp.solveSync({w: 50, h: 25}, rects);
console.log(rects);

```

```
[ { w: 10, h: 10, x: 0, y: 0 },
  { w: 25, h: 25, x: 25, y: 0 },
  { w: 15, h: 15, x: 25, y: 15 } ]
```


## API

`solveSync(options, rects);`

Pack rectangles from `rects` array in place. `rects` is an array of objects with `w` (width) and `h` (height) fields (sure, the objects can have other fields as well). After successful execution, every object will have two additional fields: `x` and `y`.


`solve(options, rects, cb);`

Pack rectangles and return new array in callback. Same as `solveSync`, but works asynchronously, and return an array of objects with two fields: `x` and `y`.


`options`

- `w` - width of bin (required)
- `h` - height of bin (required)
- `alg` - type of algorithm (default BestAreaFit):
  - BestShortSideFit or BSSF
  - BestLongSideFit or BLSF
  - BestAreaFit or BAF
  - BottomLeftRule or BL
  - ContactPointRule or CP
